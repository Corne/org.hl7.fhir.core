You can use the validator to take a QuestionnaireResponse and a Questionnaire (or IG containing the Questionnaire) and perform an extraction process
to generate resources based on the information found in the QuestionnaireResponse.

NOTE: At present, this feature only supports the 'contained resource' extraction approach.  (Refer to the Structured Data Capture IG.)

For parameters, you must specify:
-ig to identify the IG containing the CapabilityStatements, and ActorDefinitions to generate test scripts for
-output to identify the filename of the Questionnaire to create

Example: `-questionnaire-extract -questionnaire questionnaire.json -questionnaire-response response.json -output c:\someFolder\`
This will put the generated resources in the someFolder location
