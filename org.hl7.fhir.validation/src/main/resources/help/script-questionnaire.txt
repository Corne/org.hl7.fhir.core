You can use the validator to generate a Questionnaire which, when completed, can produce a TestScript (using questionnaire-extract) that
can test a specific system against a guide.  The Questionnaire will prompt a user to answer questions about which optional capabilities
defined by an IG a given system supports - allowing creation of a system-specific test script focused on exactly what the system does.

For parameters, you must specify:
-ig to identify the IG containing the CapabilityStatements, and ActorDefinitions to generate test scripts for
-questionnaire to identify the filename of the Questionnaire to create

Example: `-ig hl7.fhir.us.physical-activity#1.0.0 -script-questionnaire -output outputQuestionnaire.json`
